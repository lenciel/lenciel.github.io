![Except For Greed and Disgust](/downloads/images/american_psycho_jump.gif "Don't touch me...")

{% blockquote Mary Harron http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/ American Psycho(2000) %}
I have all the characteristics of a human being: flesh, blood, skin, hair … but not a single, clear, identifiable emotion, except for greed and disgust.
{% endblockquote %}
